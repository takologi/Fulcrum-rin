  # RocksDB bundled static library — Fulcrum-RIN is a *server* daemon that
  # reads its own database files; it does not open attacker-controlled RDB
  # files.  RocksDB memory-corruption CVEs that require specially crafted
  # .sst files are not reachable via the Electrum-protocol attack surface.
  #
  # Example (fill in actual CVE IDs after running `snyk test`):
  # SNYK-UNMANAGED-ROCKSDB-XXXXXXXX:
  #   - '*':
  #       reason: >
  #         Fulcrum only accesses its own managed RocksDB data directory.
  #         No attacker-controlled SST/manifest files are opened.
  #       expires: '2026-12-31'

  # secp256k1 — used for address-validation only (no key generation or
  # signing happens inside Fulcrum).  Side-channel CVEs in signing paths
  # are out of scope.
  #
  # SNYK-UNMANAGED-SECP256K1-XXXXXXXX:
  #   - '*':
  #       reason: >
  #         Fulcrum-RIN uses secp256k1 exclusively for public-key script
  #         validation.  No secret keys are held or generated at runtime.
